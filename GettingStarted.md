# Introduction #
Python is currently at version 2.7 and 3.0. I would strongly recommend using python 2.7, since python 3.0 is not backwards compatible and [has not been widely adopted yet](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3). Versions back to python 2.4 should work OK for projects on this site.


# Obtaining and installing Python #

## The easy way ##
Enthought distributes python and many useful packages for free for academic use:

## The hard way ##

Python packages for Windows, MacOSX and Linux can be
[downloaded from the python website](http://www.python.org/download/releases/).

Next, see if you have "easy\_install", part of setuptools. If not, you can download it by following the instructions on their site:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

### Linux ###

Most Linux distributions come with python installed.

### Mac OS X ###

MacOSX comes with python installed. Alternatively, you can use [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) to compile and install the latest python packages and much more.

Next, see if you have "easy\_install", part of setuptools. If not, you can download it by following the instructions on their site:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

You can install ipython from the terminal using:

sudo easy\_install ipython

### Windows ###
